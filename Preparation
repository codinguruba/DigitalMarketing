Digital marketing is the use of digital channels, 
such as the internet and social media, to promote and advertise products or services.

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of optimizing online content to 
improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages, ultimately driving organic traffic to a website.

The target audience refers to the specific group of people
or demographic that a product, service, or message is designed to reach and resonate with.

Demographics in marketing involve analyzing and categorizing consumer characteristics such as age, gender, income, education, and other relevant factors. 
This data helps businesses tailor their strategies to effectively reach and connect with specific audience segments.

Targeting options in marketing refer to the various criteria and parameters used to reach specific audiences with advertisements. 
This can include factors such as demographics, interests, behaviors, location, and more, enabling businesses to refine their messaging for maximum impact.


Relationship marketing in SEO not only boosts search rankings but also plays a crucial role in user retention. By cultivating positive connections, businesses create a satisfying user experience, encouraging repeat visits and prolonged engagement.
This commitment to user relationships not only contributes to SEO success but also fosters brand loyalty and customer retention
