#Digital Marketing

Digital marketing is the use of online channels and technologies to promote products, services, or brands
to a target audience, employing strategies such as SEO, social media, email, and online advertising.

Marketing is a broad business concept that involves the activities a company undertakes to promote and sell its products or services. It encompasses a range of activities aimed at understanding customer needs, creating products or services that meet those needs, and effectively promoting and distributing them to the target audience. 

A target audience refers to a specific group of people at which a product, service, or marketing message is aimed. This group is identified based on various demographic, geographic, psychographic,
and behavioral characteristics that make its members likely consumers or users of a particular offering.

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of making your website or online content more visible and attractive to search engines like Google.

In simple words, think of SEO as a way to make your website more appealing to search engines so that they recommend it to people searching for relevant topics.
