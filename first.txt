#Digital Marketing

Digital marketing is the use of online channels and technologies to promote products, services, or brands
to a target audience, employing strategies such as SEO, social media, email, and online advertising.

A target audience refers to a specific group of people at which a product, service, or marketing message is aimed. This group is identified based on various demographic, geographic, psychographic,
and behavioral characteristics that make its members likely consumers or users of a particular offering.
