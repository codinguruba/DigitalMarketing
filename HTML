HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It uses various elements and tags to structure content on a webpage.
Here's a simple example of an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is Heading</h1>
    </body>
</html>



In the context of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), the <html lang="en"> attribute is used to specify the language of the HTML document. 
This attribute is important for SEO because search engines use it to understand the language of the content on a webpage.


Language Identification: When a search engine crawls a webpage, it looks for the <html lang="en"> attribute in the HTML source code. 
The "en" in this attribute signifies that the content on the page is in English.

"hreflang" attribute, which is used to indicate the language and regional targeting of a
