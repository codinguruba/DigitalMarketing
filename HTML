HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It uses various elements and tags to structure content on a webpage.
Here's a simple example of an HTML document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is Heading</h1>
    </body>
</html>



In the context of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), the <html lang="en"> attribute is used to specify the language of the HTML document. 
This attribute is important for SEO because search engines use it to understand the language of the content on a webpage.


Language Identification: When a search engine crawls a webpage, it looks for the <html lang="en"> attribute in the HTML source code. 
The "en" in this attribute signifies that the content on the page is in English.
