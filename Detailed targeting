Detailed Targeting:

Detailed targeting involves selecting specific criteria and characteristics to define a highly specific audience for your marketing efforts.
This can be done through various means, including demographics, interests, behaviors, and more.

Audience Segmentation: When creating a Facebook or Instagram ad campaign,
you can define your target audience based on various criteria. This can include demographic information such as 
age, gender, location, education, and relationship status.

Interests and Behaviors: You can narrow down your audience by specifying their interests, behaviors, and preferences.
This includes their likes, hobbies, the pages they follow, the apps they use, and even their purchasing behavior.


For a coffee shop, detailed targeting means catering to diverse customer segments, including professionals needing a quiet workspace, students seeking study-friendly spaces, health-conscious coffee lovers, local community events,
and quick options for morning commuters.
Tailor your marketing and in-store experience to connect with each segment, building loyalty among coffee aficionados with diverse preferences.
